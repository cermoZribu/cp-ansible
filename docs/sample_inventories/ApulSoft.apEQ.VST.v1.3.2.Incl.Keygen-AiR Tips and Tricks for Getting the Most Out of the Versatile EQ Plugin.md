- A spectrum analyzer that shows the frequency response of the input and output signals, as well as the EQ curve. The analyzer can be switched between linear and logarithmic scales, and can be frozen or averaged over time.
- A phase correlation meter that shows the stereo phase relationship of the input and output signals. The meter can help identify phase issues and correct them with the stereo width control or the mid/side mode.
- A stereo width control that allows adjusting the stereo image of the input and output signals. The control can be used to widen or narrow the stereo field, or to invert the left and right channels.
- A mid/side processing mode that allows applying different EQ settings to the mid (mono) and side (stereo difference) components of the input and output signals. The mode can be used to enhance the stereo depth, balance, or clarity of the sound.
- A built-in limiter that prevents clipping and distortion of the output signal. The limiter can be enabled or disabled, and has a threshold and a release parameter.

ApulSoft apEQ is easy to use and intuitive. It has a user-friendly interface that shows all the relevant controls and information on a single window. Users can adjust the EQ bands by dragging the nodes on the EQ curve, or by using the knobs below. Users can also use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out on the EQ curve, or to change the filter type of each band. Users can save and load presets, or use the randomize function to generate new EQ settings.

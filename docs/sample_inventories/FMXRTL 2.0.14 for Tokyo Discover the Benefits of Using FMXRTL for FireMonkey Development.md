In this article, we will show you how to use FMXRTL 2.0.14 for Tokyo to create a simple FireMonkey application that supports RTL languages. We will use Delphi as the programming language, but you can also use C++Builder if you prefer.
 
The first step is to install FMXRTL 2.0.14 for Tokyo on your computer. You can download the installer from [www.fmxrtl.com/download](https://www.fmxrtl.com/download) and follow the instructions to complete the installation. After that, you can launch RAD Studio 10.3 Tokyo and create a new FireMonkey application.
 
The next step is to add the FMXRTL units to your project. You can do this by adding the following line to the uses clause of your main form unit:
 `uses FMXRTL;` 
This will allow you to access the FMXRTL classes and properties in your code. You can also drop the FMXRTL components from the Tool Palette onto your form at design-time.
 
The third step is to set the bi-directional mode of your form and controls. You can do this by using the TFMXBiDiMode property, which has three possible values: LeftToRight, RightToLeft and NoBiDi. The default value is LeftToRight, which means that the form and controls will behave as usual in FireMonkey. If you want to enable RTL support, you need to set the TFMXBiDiMode property to RightToLeft for your form and any control that you want to mirror or align according to the RTL layout. You can also set the TFMXBiDiMode property to NoBiDi for any control that you want to exclude from the RTL behavior.
 
For example, let's say that we want to create a simple form with a label, an edit and a button. We want the label and the edit to be aligned to the right and the button to be aligned to the left in RTL mode. We also want the text direction and alignment of the edit to be reversed in RTL mode. To achieve this, we need to set the TFMXBiDiMode property of the form, the label and the edit to RightToLeft, and leave the TFMXBiDiMode property of the button as LeftToRight. We also need to set the TextSettings.HorzAlign property of the edit to Leading in order to make it align with its parent.
 
The following screenshot shows how our form looks like in design-time with RTL mode enabled:

The following screenshot shows how our form looks like in run-time with RTL mode enabled:
 ![Form in run-time with RTL mode enabled](https://i.imgur.com/9J1xqyO.png) 
The fourth step is to handle RTL switching at run-time. You can do this by using the TFMXApplication class, which provides a method called SetBiDiMode that allows you to change the bi-directional mode of your application at run-time. You can also use the GetBiDiMode method to get the current bi-directional mode of your application.
 
For example, let's say that we want to add a menu item that allows the user to switch between LTR and RTL modes at run-time. We can do this by adding a TMainMenu component to our form and adding a menu item called "Switch BiDi Mode". We can then write an OnClick event handler for this menu item that calls the SetBiDiMode method of TFMXApplication with the opposite value of its current bi-directional mode.
 `procedure TForm1.MenuItem1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  if FMXApplication.GetBiDiMode = TFMXBiDiMode.LeftToRight then
    FMXApplication.SetBiDiMode(TFMXBiDiMode.RightToLeft)
  else
    FMXApplication.SetBiDiMode(TFMXBiDiMode.LeftToRight);
end;` 
This will cause our form and controls to switch their bi-directional mode accordingly. The following screenshot shows how our form looks like in run-time after switching from LTR mode to RTL mode:

The final step is to test our application on different platforms and languages. You can do this

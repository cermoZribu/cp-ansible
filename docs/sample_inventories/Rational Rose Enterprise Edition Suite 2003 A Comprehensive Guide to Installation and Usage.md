Rational Rose Enterprise Edition Suite 2003 is a powerful tool that can help you create high-quality software applications using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). UML is a standard way of representing the structure, behavior and interactions of software systems using diagrams and symbols. UML can help you communicate your ideas clearly, avoid errors and inconsistencies, and reuse existing components and patterns.
 
With Rational Rose Enterprise Edition Suite 2003, you can create and edit eight types of UML diagrams: use case diagrams, class diagrams, object diagrams, sequence diagrams, collaboration diagrams, statechart diagrams, activity diagrams and component diagrams. Each diagram type has its own purpose and notation. For example, use case diagrams show the goals and scenarios of the users of the system, class diagrams show the static structure and relationships of the classes in the system, and sequence diagrams show the dynamic interactions and messages between objects in the system.
 
Rational Rose Enterprise Edition Suite 2003 also integrates with other Rational tools and products, such as Rational ClearCase, Rational RequisitePro, Rational TestManager and Rational XDE. You can use these tools to manage your requirements, configuration, testing and deployment processes. You can also generate code from your models, reverse engineer existing code into models, and synchronize your code and models to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Rational Rose Enterprise Edition Suite 2003 is a versatile and user-friendly tool that can help you create high-quality software applications using UML. You can use the graphical user interface to drag and drop elements, create links, add properties and annotations, and customize the appearance of your diagrams. You can also use the browser to navigate and organize your model elements, view their properties and relationships, and access various commands and options.
 
Rational Rose Enterprise Edition Suite 2003 also supports team collaboration and version control. You can share your models with other developers, review and comment on each other's work, and merge changes using Rational ClearCase. You can also track the history and status of your models, compare different versions, and undo or redo changes using Rational Rose Modeler.

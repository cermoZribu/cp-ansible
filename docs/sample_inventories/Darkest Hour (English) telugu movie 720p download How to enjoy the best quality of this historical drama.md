Darkest Hour (English) Telugu movie 720p download is also a movie that will surprise you with some fascinating trivia and behind-the-scenes stories. For example, did you know that Gary Oldman spent a year studying Winston Churchill and his mannerisms before starting on this movie?[^2^] He also had to endure hours of makeup and prosthetics to transform into the iconic leader, and smoked thousands of pounds worth of cigars on-set, which gave him nicotine poisoning.[^2^]
 
Another interesting fact is that John Hurt was originally cast as Neville Chamberlain, the previous Prime Minister who resigned due to his appeasement policy towards Hitler. However, Hurt was ill with cancer and died before he could film any scenes. The movie was dedicated to him as a tribute.[^2^]
 
Darkest Hour (English) Telugu movie 720p download also has some historical inaccuracies and dramatizations that you should be aware of. For instance, the scene where Churchill rides the London Underground and talks to ordinary citizens never happened in real life. It was invented by the screenwriter Anthony McCarten as a way of showing Churchill's connection with the people.[^4^] Similarly, the scene where Churchill calls Franklin Roosevelt and asks for help was fictionalized. In reality, Churchill and Roosevelt never spoke directly until December 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor.[^4^]

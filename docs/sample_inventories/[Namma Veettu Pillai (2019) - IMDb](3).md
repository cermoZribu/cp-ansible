Enga Vittu Pillai (1965) is a Tamil language film starring M. G. Ramachandran, B. Saroja Devi, M. N. Nambiar and S. V. Ranga Rao in the lead roles. The film was directed by Tapi Chanakya and produced by B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani under their banner Vijaya Vauhini Studios. The film was a remake of the Telugu film Ramudu Bheemudu (1964), which itself was inspired by the Hollywood film The Prisoner of Zenda (1937). The film was a blockbuster hit and ran for over 100 days in theatres[^2^].
 
The film revolves around Ramu, an innocent son of a rich landlord who is afraid of his brother-in-law Narendran and his whiplash. To escape from his punishments, Ramu leaves his house and his look-alike Ilango, a brave and adventurous young man, replaces him. Ilango falls in love with Leela, the daughter of a rival landlord, and also helps Ramu's family to overcome their enemies. The film is a mix of drama, action, comedy and romance, with memorable songs composed by Viswanathan Ramamurthy and lyrics by Vaali[^1^] [^3^].
